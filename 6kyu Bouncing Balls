#A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.
#He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
#His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
#How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?
