#5 people are in the queue for a "Double Cola" drink vending machine; there are no other people in the queue. 
#The first one in the queue buys a can, drinks it and doubles! The resulting two people go to the end of the queue. 
#Then the next in the queue buys a can, drinks it and gets to the end of the queue as two, and so on.

#Write a program that will return the name of the person who will drink the n-th cola.
#input is list of names and integer n

def who_is_next(names, r):
    n=len(names) #how many names
    q=n #length of queue
    i=0 #iteration number
    
    while r>=q:
        i+=1
        q+=(2**i)*n #each iteration adds 2^i of each name
    
    #now remove each set of 2^i names until q<r:
    j=n
    while q>=r:
        q=q-(2**i)
